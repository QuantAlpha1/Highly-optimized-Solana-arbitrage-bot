üîí Token Security Checks

    Ownership Check

        Verifies if mint authority exists (centralized token = red flag)

    Blacklist Check

        Cross-references known scam token databases

    Mint Address Validation

        Confirms the token's mint account is legitimate

    Account Existence Check

        Validates the token account is properly initialized

üíß Liquidity Checks

    Liquidity Lock

        Checks for freeze authority (indicates locked liquidity)

    Owner Pool Access

        Detects if creator controls the LP (centralization risk)

    Token Distribution

        Analyzes top holders for excessive concentration (>50% = unsafe)

üõ°Ô∏è Transaction Safety

    Basic TX Simulation

        Tests if transfers are possible

    Approval/Transfer Check

        Verifies the token isn't transfer-restricted

üïµÔ∏è Advanced Scam Detection

    Honeypot Check

        Simulates buys/sells to detect price manipulation

    Burn Mechanism Check

        Validates token has proper burn functionality

    Renounced Ownership

        Checks if mint authority is null (fully decentralized)

üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

    Each check has independent failure handling (won't crash the bot)

    Results are cached for 150 tokens (MAX_CACHE_SIZE)

    Checks run in batches with delays to avoid rate limiting
